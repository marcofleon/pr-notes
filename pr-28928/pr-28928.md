# [28928](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/28928/): add coverage for bech32m in `wallet_keypool_topup`

## Concepts to Understand
A keypool is a set of pre-generated (private and public) keys that a wallet maintains for immediate generation of new addresses without the need to generate new keys on the spot for every new transaction or address request. This makes it easier to avoid address reuse (privacy enhancement), as it's more efficient to get a new address from the keypool.

The "top up" here refers to when the keypool is replenished after the number of unused keys falls below a certain threshold. This is done automatically in the wallet to ensure that there's always a ready supply of new addresses that can be used for transactions.

## PR Improvements
This PR enhances the functional test `wallet_keypool_topup` by:
- adding bech32m addresses (introduced as part of the Taproot upgrade) to the test. It makes sure to do this only if descriptor wallets are being used. 
    ```bash
    output_types = ["legacy", "p2sh-segwit", "bech32"]
    if self.options.descriptors:
        output_types.append("bech32m")
    ```

- using multiple wallets on one node instead of multiple nodes. This simplifies the test setup quite a bit and still keeps the main functionality of testing keypool restoration. I'll check to see how much time is saved with this change.


done: pulled the pr, compiled with bdb enabled, ran test (with --legacy-wallet option too)\
todo: poke test code a little more thoroughly, compare time saved between old and new test
